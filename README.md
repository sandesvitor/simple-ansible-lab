# Simple Ansible LAB
## **Creating a lab with vagrant and ansible, for hosting a simple web service**

---

After running **up** command, a file **ok.txt** should be created in the main folder, containing:
```shell
ubuntu-server | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
10.0.2.15 192.168.55.101 
ubuntu-database | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
10.0.2.15 192.168.55.102 
ubuntu-master | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
10.0.2.15 192.168.55.100 
```
This indicates that the vms are up, and the **first_steps.sh** scri ran without any major problem.
